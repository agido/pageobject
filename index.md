PageObject is a Page Object Pattern implementation written in Scala.

PageObject is a free, open-source ([Apache Licence v2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt)) extension for test runners implementing the Page Object Pattern.
Currently only ScalaTest 3 is supported, but other testing frameworks should be easy to add.

```
$ sbt publishLocal
```

if you want to try it.

## Download PageObject
The code is hosted and developed in the [PageObject GitHub repository](https://github.com/agido/pageobject/).
